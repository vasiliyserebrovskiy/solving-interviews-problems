# Task Solutions Project

This repository contains solutions to various programming tasks and exercises.  
Each task is organized in its own package/folder.

P.S. The task descriptions are taken from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

## Project Structure

- `task_<number>/`
    - `task_description.md` – task description
    - solution files – depending on the task, this may include subfolders with solution files or just individual solution files

## How to Use

1. Browse the task folder to find a problem you want to explore.
2. Read the `task_description.md` file for the problem description.
3. Check the solution file in the same folder for the implementation and explanations.

## Adding New Tasks

1. Create a new folder/package for the task.
2. Add a `task_description.md` file with the problem description.
3. Add the solution file with explanations in the same folder.
